# DataSierra Test Setup - Complete ✅

## 🎉 Tests Successfully Moved to `tests/` Folder

Your integration tests have been successfully moved to the `tests/` folder and are fully functional from the root directory.

## 📁 File Structure

```
DataSierra/
├── tests/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── health_check.py
│   ├── quick_integration_tests.py
│   ├── integration_tests.py
│   ├── run_tests.py
│   ├── test_config.json
│   └── README.md
├── test.py          # Root-level test runner
├── health.py        # Root-level health check
└── Makefile         # Easy test commands
```

## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### Option 1: Root Directory Commands (Recommended)
```bash
# Run all integration tests
python3.11 test.py

# Run health check only
python3.11 health.py
```

### Option 2: Makefile Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run health check
make health

# Run quick tests directly
make test-quick

# Run comprehensive tests
make test-full

# Show help
make help
```

### Option 3: Direct from Tests Folder
```bash
cd tests

# Run all tests
python3.11 run_tests.py

# Run health check
python3.11 health_check.py

# Run quick tests
python3.11 quick_integration_tests.py

# Run comprehensive tests
python3.11 integration_tests.py
```

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **Import Paths**: Updated all test files to correctly import from the project root
2. **Path Resolution**: Fixed `sys.path.append()` to go up one level from `tests/` folder
3. **Cross-References**: Fixed imports between test files
4. **Root Access**: Created `test.py` and `health.py` in root for easy access
5. **Makefile**: Added convenient commands for test execution

## 🎯 Next Steps

Your test suite is now properly organized and fully functional. You can:

1. **Run tests anytime** using `python3.11 test.py` or `make test`
2. **Check system health** using `python3.11 health.py` or `make health`
3. **Add new tests** to the `tests/` folder following the same pattern
4. **Integrate with CI/CD** using the test commands

The test suite will help you verify that all DataSierra features continue working correctly as you develop new functionality.
